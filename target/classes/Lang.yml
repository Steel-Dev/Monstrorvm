# Valid placeholders:
#  Custom Mobs:
#    MOBID, MOBNAME, MOBAMOUNT, MOBKEY

# NOTE: The placeholders will only get the proper value filled in if the changed message is within
#  the context. EG: adding 'KEY' from crafting related messages in the Prefix wont be filled in.
#  this is to prevent unneeded values being put into our messages.
#
# Traditional color codes supported, and Hex.
#  EG: &cHi! <#5C040F>Hey!
